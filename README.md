# AI-Powered Structural Defect Detection System

**Structural Defect Detection** is an AI-driven computer vision application designed to automatically identify, classify, and document construction defects from site images — improving safety, quality control, and operational efficiency across construction projects.

---

## Problem Statement

In large-scale construction projects, inspection of civil structures such as: Buildings, Bridges and Industrial facilities is typically performed through **manual visual checks**.

This traditional approach suffers from:

- High dependency on human expertise and judgment  
- Subjective and inconsistent defect identification  
- Delayed discovery of structural issues  
- Poor standardization of reporting formats  
- Increased safety risks and rework costs  

Common defects such as **cracks, honeycombing, uneven plaster, and surface deformities** often go unnoticed until advanced stages of construction.

---

## Business Objective

To develop an **AI-powered vision-based system** that automates:

- Structural defect detection  
- Defect classification and severity assessment  
- Standardized documentation and reporting  

The system aims to provide:

- Accurate and consistent inspection results  
- Faster turnaround during active construction phases  
- Scalable integration into quality assurance workflows  
- Decision support for site engineers and project managers  

---

## Proposed Solution

An end-to-end **AI-powered structural inspection platform** built using:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for defect detection  
- **Google Gemini** for multimodal visual understanding  
- **Streamlit** for intuitive user interaction  

### Core Workflow:

1. Upload construction site images  
2. AI analyzes visual defects  
3. Defects are classified and evaluated  
4. Structured reports are generated automatically
